## Hi there 👋

I'm NupeFirstSon a Web3 & community manager and junior developer. Love exploring DeFi, NFTs, prediction markets and AI, I help projects grow and thrive.

I work primarily in JS, vibecoding dApps and exploring the decentralized ecosystem. Always learning, creating, and connecting communities.

- Currently contributing on prismax and nous research;
  
- PrismaX is a decentralized network for physical AI that lets people control robots remotely. Robot operators provide real-world data, powering AI companies to train advanced, intelligent systems.

- Nous research is an open-source AI research organization dedicated to developing advanced language models, including the Hermes series, Nomos, and NousCoder. The organization focuses on 
open research, decentralized AI training, and community-driven development, prioritizing innovation over product or marketing agendas.
